        <h2> Mapping NYC: An Exploration Of Its Job Market   </h2>  <span>  by Joanna Lin Su </span> </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p> When Fitz Gerald first called NYC "the Big Apple", he probably didn't think about that the term would go this popular now. People are describing New
            York as "a city that never sleeps", "the center of the universe", or even as "a trap". Tourists around the globe come to New York to see the charging bull from the Wall
            Street, to go shopping on the Fifth Avenue, or to watch performing arts at Broadway...  </p>
            <p> But, except all these fancy labels, how does the city function everyday? What are the average people doing in their day to day life? I look into its job market, trying to figure out what does New York actually look
            like. </p>
            <p> Here is a general sense: New York City is home to more than 4 million jobs. It uses 2.5% of the total labor market of the States in generating
                5% of the U.S. total wages. </p>
            <p>You may probably already have a good sense of how these jobs
                locate geographically. But the size of each parts is still vague, neither does how much they earn. </p>

        <div class="wage">
            <p> <span> When grouped by occupations, these are among the top list.ðŸ‘‡ </span></p>
            </br></br><img src="rank.png" width="120%"> </div>


            <p> The following treemap is an experiment, through which it shows more than half of the total jobs are about business, professional, and services. While in general "office and administrative support" has most people working on, NYC has about 147 thousand home health aides(under the "healthcare support" category), more than any other job titles. As a
                journalist, it is also surprising for me to see that the city has way fewer reporters and correspondents than personal relation specialists, editors, or even graphic designers. What about your industry?</p>

    <p> Regarding to the wage, there is no much difference when it comes to the entry level jobs except one occupation- management. Managers, which is counted as the sixth largest group in NYC job market, have much higher wages even when they are just getting started. The wage ceilings are quite
        different for each occupation. They generally go into three bundles while lawyers and salespeople are having the most "robust potential".
        And home health aids, the job has most New Yorkers working on, is offering the lowest income. </br> </br> <span> Explore it yourself! ðŸ‘‡ </span></p> </div>
